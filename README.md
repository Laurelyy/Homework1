# Homework1

## What are the names of the people in your study group?
- Cisse, Herbe, Jen, Joel, Rimo

## 2. Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic test by end of the day Friday Sept 24. 
- 

## 3.  this is due before class During class on Thursday Sept 2, we’ll do experiments on sequences of random numbers. I gave out dice in first class, for you to play with sanding, filing, heating, drilling, gluing, squeezing or whatever to see if you can adjust which numbers come up. Before class, you should have done about 20 experiments where you roll the dice and record whether the result was a 6 or not.
- Uploaded under "Die Experiment" 
- __Note: One die was boiled, then purposefully melted on the #4 side. The dice were thrown on a soft bouncy surface (my couch) while altered die was still warm from the fire.__

## 4. Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the lecture notes R Basics for Lecture 1 to do some simple stats on the PUMS-NY data. Those notes request that you find average ages for men and women after accounting for the top-coding. Tell me something else interesting, that you learned from the data, for example about educational attainments in different neighborhoods in the city. Are there surprises for you?

- Yes...


## 5. Differences in means can be complicated. Find the mean return on SP500 index (choose a time period). What is the mean return on days when the previous day’s return was positive? When the previous 2 days were positive? Negative? Now read about “hot hands fallacy” and tell if you think that helps investment strategy. (You might start with this tweet, and read the papers referenced.)
